# FingerPainting-App

This App allows the user to trace and draw with four colors - Red, Green, Blue and Black. On top of this, the app contains the following functionalities

Building on this, modify the program to do the following:
1.	 A slider control that changes the size of the circle from radius 3 to 23dp.
2.	As the user moves their finger, it draws a line from the last point to the current one, which allows the users to draw random lines
3.	When the user lifts their finger, it stops painting.
4.	When you touch the screen again, it paints starting from that point.
5.	An “undo” button that undoes the last complete line.
